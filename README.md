# sudokuInPy

This is a basic sudoku solver that works with limited easy puzzles. I designed it with the intention of using the algorithms with a future app, but have since moved to a new (project)[https://github.com/CameronDennis/sudokuInCpp] in C++, where I will be implementing backtracking and image parsing.
